# Hello World Google Cloud Endpoints Frameworks for App Engine using a discovery document

This generated sample provides an example of a [migration][7] from the prior version of
[Google Cloud Endpoints Frameworks][3] to new [Google Cloud Endpoints Frameworks for App Engine][8]
while still using a discovery document. This sample contains comments of how to 
use the prior Endpoints Frameworks as well. For clarity, the prior Endpoints
Frameworks and the new Endpoints Frameworks are denoted as Endpoints Frameworks v1.0
and Endpoints Frameworks v2.0 respectively.

Google Cloud Endpoints Frameworks v2.0 provides new functionality which may
require payment and uses an OpenAPI specification instead of the discovery document.
The OpenAPI development process is explained [here][8] and a quickstart is
provided [here][9].


## Products
- [Google App Engine Standard][1]

## Language
- [Java][2]

## APIs
- [Google Cloud Endpoints Frameworks v2.0][8]
- [Google Cloud Endpoints Frameworks v1.0][3]

## Build and Deployment Plugins
- [Google Cloud Endpoints Frameworks Maven Plugin][10]
- [Google Cloud Endpoints Frameworks Gradle Plugin][11]

## Setup
1. [Optional]: User Authenticating with Google Accounts in Web Clients

    1. Update the `WEB_CLIENT_ID` in [Constants.java](src/main/java/${packageInPathFormat}/Constants.java)
      to reflect the web client ID you have registered in the [Credentials on Developers Console for OAuth 2.0 client IDs][6].

    1. Update the value of `google.devrel.samples.helloendpoints.CLIENT_ID` in [base.js](src/main/webapp/js/base.js)
       to reflect the web client ID you have registered in the [Credentials on Developers Console for OAuth 2.0 client IDs][6].

1. [Optional]: User Authenticating with Google Accounts in other Applications Types

    - Inside [Constants.java](src/main/java/${packageInPathFormat}/Constants.java) you will find placeholders for Android
      and iOS applications using Google Accounts client IDs registered in the
      [Credentials on Developers Console for OAuth 2.0 client IDs][6].

    - These client IDs are used when defining annotation for this sample API found in [Greetings.java](src/main/java/${packageInPathFormat}/Greetings.java).

    - You can read more about different user authentication supported [here][12].

1. [Optional]: Use Cloud Endpoints Frameworks v2.0 Maven and Gradle discovery and
   client library generation plugins with Cloud Endpoints Frameworks v1.0.

    - Uncomment `Endpoints Frameworks v1.0` sections and comment
        `Endpoints Frameworks v2.0` sections in the following files.

      ```
        pom.xml
        build.gradle
        src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml
      ```

###  Maven

1. Build a fresh binary with

    `mvn clean compile`

1. Run the application locally at [localhost:8080][5] with

    `mvn appengine:run`

1. Generate the client library in a zip file named `helloworld-v1-java.zip` with

    `mvn endpoints-framework:clientLibs`

1. Deploy your application to Google App Engine with

    `mvn appengine:deploy`

### Gradle

1. Build a fresh binary with

    `gradle clean compileJava`

1. Run the application locally at [localhost:8080][5] with

    `gradle appengineRun`

1. Generate the client library in a zip file named `helloworld-v1-java.zip` with

    `gradle endpointsClientLibs`

1. Deploy your application to Google App Engine with

    `gradle appengineDeploy`
